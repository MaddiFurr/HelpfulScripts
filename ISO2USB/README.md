# ISO2USB
Write ISO files to USB sticks

Script takes two arguments

Argument 1: Drive path (something like /dev/sda)
Argument 2: ISO file path

The script will then ask you for confirmation of writing the data to the disk. After confirmation, it will write the ISO file to the disk. All data will be lost on the disk, so be sure you choose the right one.
